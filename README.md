## CS 5330: Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision

Northeastern University | Spring 2026 | Prof. Bruce Maxwell


This repository contains my implementations of computer vision systems developed during CS 5330. The course covers the full spectrum of vision, from fundamental image formation and classical filtering to modern deep learning architectures.

📚 Course Overview
The primary goal of this course is to extract meaningful information from digital images. 
Key themes include:

Image Formation: Camera calibration, geometry, and physics of reflection.

Classical Vision: Filtering (Bilateral, Fourier), Texture analysis, and Morphology.

Feature Engineering: Region features, SIFT/SURF, and object segmentation.

Modern Vision: Deep Convolutional Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and Generative Models (GANs/Diffusion).

🚀 Projects
The curriculum consists of six projects developed using C++, Python, OpenCV, and PyTorch.

Projects coming soon...
